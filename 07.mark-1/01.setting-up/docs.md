# Setup Instructions

There is a overall setup pdf located [here](https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Mark_1_User_Guide.pdf) with instructions on setting up
the Mark 1.

# Changing Password
It is a good idea to change the password.  By default the password for the mark 1 is `mycroft`.  In order to change this you would ssh to it or connect a hdmi cable to the port on the back of the Mark 1 unit.

From the console/ssh session enter the following command:

`passwd`

It will prompt you for the current password, then new password twice, and then the new password will be saved.

example output:
```
Changing password for pi.
(current) UNIX password:
Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully
```
