# Introduction to Document
This document is a work in progress and will continually be updated and fixed during the development cycle and as new issues are found and worked on.

The below sections should walk you through the process of setting up Mycroft-core in linux environments (for now) with available dependencies. In addition we have guides for starting the services and using them. You can be part of the discussion and ask questions in the Slack channels and forums. Check out the [contributing section.](https://docs.mycroft.ai/contributing)
